In no particular order:

* add check for use org/proj#NN for PR or issue (eg, if reference github in
  references or bugs, then look for ' NNNN ' in description and notes). See
  https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls
* end-to-end verification with compatUbuntu = True
* do membership checks instead of rePatterns in common.py
* use a cache always with mtime
* simple report
* add a 'pull script' to pull data from mitre/nvd. By default pull everything
  and loop for anything missing (eg, the distro case) but add an 'limit' file
  to be a list of projects to add (everything else skipped rather than added
  to ignored; this would be case-insensitive grep on ' <software> ')
* create a tool to intelligently create/update the include list
