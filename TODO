In no particular order:

* update data format for tracking OCIs
* unfold correctly so we can differentiate different lines (useful for checking
  'References' when have 'https://foo.bar (baz)'
* finish checks for various fields
* add a mechanism for listing projects we care about (eg, in -cve-data?)
* add check for use org/proj#NN for PR or issue (eg, if reference github in
  references or bugs, then look for ' NNNN ' in description and notes). See
  https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls
* document the CVE file format. Note additions from UCT:
 * released (<hash>) # ie, instead of version, put the hash for rolling
   releases
